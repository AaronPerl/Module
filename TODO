Current WIP Features in order of completion

Textures
	Texture class which has a pointer to a TextureData class
	TextureData classes are extended by GraphicsInterface implementations
		Contain implementation-specific texture data (i.e. Texture ID)

Rendering 2D polygons
	Polygon container class that stores vertices, vertex colors, texture coords for rendering 2D polygons (i.e. GUI)
		Only 1 texture per polygon container? More? How so (efficiently)?
			1 initially, perhaps more in the future
	Stores information to keep track of which polygon each vertex belongs to for easy translation/deletion
		Should polygons have a name?
		Lookup (polygon to vertices) and reverse lookup (vertex to polygon)
			Without having to iterate over every previous polygon (store a start index)
			Reverse lookup without iterating over polygons? (map?)
				Updating when polygons are removed
	Translation of entire polygon containers
	Clipping edges for polygon containers
		Rectangular or arbitrary?

Click Handlers:
	Priority based (lower values are called first)
	If a click handler returns true, the event was processed
		Otherwise, continue by calling the next click handler by order of priority
